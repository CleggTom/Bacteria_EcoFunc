The general idea here is to develop a simple model that can describe the evolution of bacterial carbon biomass through time. This model will then be used to describe the temperature dependence of carbon biomass growth. This model will also be extended to include interactions between species which \n",

    "# Bacterial Growth Model\n",
    "Much of the work here is inspired by the approach of Manzoni & Porporato ([2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071709000765)) who reviewed the various modeling approaches used to look at carbon and nitrogen mineralisation. Though they focused on models describing the action of soil bacteria, the general approaches they use are applicable to aquatic enviroments too (such as in our expereiment). In their paper the authours present a simple graphical model describing the flow of carbon through bacterial biomass which is recreated below:"

In seperating these two components we are able to distinguish between the the types of respiratory losses that occur over different stages of growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this framework maintenance respiration is assumes to be constant as individual bacteria will always need to expend energy (and carbon) to maintain the processes detailed above. As such this respiratory cost is assumed to scale with biomass with the simplest relationship being a linear one (i.e. $R_m = C_B \\tilde{R}_m$ where the tilde indicates the constant mass-specific rate of maintenence respiration).\n",
    "\n",
    "Growth respiration is commonly assumed to scale with uptake rate and is usually assumed to be a constant proportion of uptake (i.e $R_g = (1-\\epsilon)U$ where $\\epsilon$ is the proportion of uptake allocated to growth, $\\frac{U - R_g}{U}$). Substituting this into the equation for bacterial biomass above gives:\n",
